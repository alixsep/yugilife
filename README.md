When I was 15yo, I was publishing Yugioh card templates for Photoshop in Deviantart. Making cards was a hobby for me because I could print them and play. However, the editing was quite time consuming. Unfortunately at that time I had no other choice and it's because of this that I always wanted to make a faster solution.
As of this point (Aug, 2020), it had been 6 months since I've started web development when I came back to the idea of making a faster solution for making Yugioh cards. I created this website by myself as a solo project. I watched a lot of tutorials, spent a lot of time searching the web, and I finally made this, and it works really well and BLAZING FAST! Not to mention that these cards are not only for print and play, but also for any request for digital proxies, like ygopro, or something similar.

I hope you enjoy this website! Regards & love ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’–
